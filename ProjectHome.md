BlenderEP is a tool for the setup and execution of EnergyPlus models within Blender.

BlenderEP is a derivative of the [BlendME](https://sites.google.com/site/opendesignsolutions/blendme) project for the specialisation of more advanced EnergyPlus modelling that is not included in the [BlendME](https://sites.google.com/site/opendesignsolutions/blendme) project.

**Please be patient while we prepare for an initial release once the Blender API becomes stable after the release of v2.6.  In the meantime please subscribe to the [Discussion Group](http://groups.google.com/group/blendme) or the [News Feed](https://sites.google.com/site/opendesignsolutions/news) to stay up-to-date with developments**
